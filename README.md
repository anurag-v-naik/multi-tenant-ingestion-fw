The Data Ingestion Framework is a powerful tool for automating data movement and processing. It is composed of three main components: a backend to manage configurations, a frontend for user interaction, and a Python engine for pipeline execution.

Core Features:

Modular Connectors: Easily connect to various data sources (e.g., databases, filesystems, APIs) and destinations.

Pluggable Processors: Apply a wide range of data transformations, such as data quality checks, anonymization, and schema validation.

Flexible Pipelines: Define end-to-end data flows by chaining connectors and processors.

Scheduling: Automate pipeline execution using familiar cron-based syntax.

Extensible Architecture: Easily add new connectors and processors without modifying core framework code.

Conceptual Architecture:

The framework's design follows a clear separation of concerns, as illustrated in this simplified diagram:

graph TD
    A[Frontend] -->|API Calls| B(Backend Service)
    B -->|Configuration| C(PostgreSQL Database)
    B -->|Execution Trigger| D[Python Engine]
    D --> E[Databricks / Spark]
    E --> F[Data Source / Target]

Quick Start
Follow these steps to get the framework running locally for development and testing.

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/data-ingestion-framework.git
cd data-ingestion-framework

Start Services with Docker Compose
This command will build and run the backend, frontend, and database containers.

docker-compose up --build -d

Run Migrations
Once the database container is healthy, run the database migrations to set up the schema.

# Connect to the backend container's shell
docker-compose exec backend /bin/sh

# Run migrations from within the container
npm run migrate

Usage
Once the services are running, you can begin to use the framework.

Access the Frontend: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the user interface for managing connectors, processors, and pipelines.

Create Components: Use the UI or the API to create new Connectors, Processors, and Pipelines. You can define connections to your data sources and destinations, and configure the necessary data transformations.

Run a Pipeline:

Manually: From the frontend, you can trigger a pipeline run with a single click.

Via API: Send a POST request to the /api/pipelines/:id/run endpoint.

Scheduled: Create a new Schedule using the UI or API and provide a cron syntax for automated execution.
